## About
This is the branch with support of parallelized network training with [Hogwild](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~brecht/papers/hogwildTR.pdf)! so as to speed up the training process significantly. No different usage is required, the code auto-detects the number of logical cores and runs a thread on each one.
